### **UI Design Style**
Develop the app following the visual style and design principles shown in the provided image. Ensure the app design incorporates the following elements:

1. **Soft and Friendly Visuals**:
   - Use **rounded corners** for all cards, buttons, and containers.
   - Apply a **soft color palette** with light and pastel tones (e.g., beige, green, yellow, and brown).
   - Incorporate **subtle gradients** or background patterns for depth while keeping the interface clean.

2. **Typography**:
   - Use a **modern, sans-serif font** with clear and legible text.
   - Employ **hierarchical typography**:
     - Large and bold headings for key metrics or prompts.
     - Smaller, lighter text for secondary information.

3. **Icons and Imagery**:
   - Use **minimalistic and rounded icons** for navigation and actions.
   - Include **emoji-like visuals** for user interactions (e.g., mood sliders, feedback screens).
   - Add subtle illustrations where appropriate to make the app feel friendly and inviting.

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Buttons and sliders should:
     - Be **large and tappable**, with clear feedback on interaction (e.g., ripple effects or subtle scaling animations).
     - Use bold, contrasting colors for primary actions (e.g., "Set Mood," "Create Journal").
   - Incorporate **floating action buttons (FABs)** for key actions, such as adding entries or navigating.

5. **Charts and Visual Data**:
   - Use **rounded line charts** or bar charts to display trends (e.g., mood history or mental health metrics).
   - Ensure all charts are visually appealing with soft edges and dynamic transitions.

6. **White Space and Layout**:
   - Maintain **ample white space** to avoid clutter and ensure focus on important elements.
   - Use **card-based layouts** for grouping content (e.g., mood history, recommendations).

7. **Transitions and Animations**:
   - Add **smooth transitions** for page navigation, modal openings, and data updates.
   - Use **micro-interactions** for feedback, such as button presses, mood selection, or activity logging.

8. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure sufficient **contrast ratios** for readability.
   - All interactive elements should follow **touch-friendly guidelines** (e.g., minimum 48x48px tappable areas).
